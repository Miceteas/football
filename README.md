# Football Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a 2D football game developed as part of the semester-end project for the computer science bachelor's degree (UFC - **U**niversity of **F**ranche-**C**omté). The project leverages the Gamedev Framework (gf) library to create a top-down football game inspired by the dynamic and arcade-like gameplay of early football games.

# Description

Football games have been a staple of video gaming since its inception, evolving from simple 2D designs to hyper-realistic 3D simulations. However, the charm of the early football games lay in their 2D top-down perspective and arcade-style gameplay, offering fast-paced and dynamic matches.

The goal of this project is to recreate that classic experience by developing a 2D football game with a minimalist design and highly simplified physics.

## Features

* Top-down Gameplay: Classic 2D perspective for a retro gaming experience.
* Single Player and AI: Play against an AI opponent.
* Simplified Physics: A lightweight physics engine to keep the game intuitive and responsive.
* Dynamic Matches: Focus on fun and fast-paced gameplay.

## Technologies

* Programming Language: C++
* Game Development Library: Gamedev Framework (gf)
